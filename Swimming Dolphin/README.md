## Description
At the end of the project, this is going to simulate a dolphin that is swimming. The final product needs to be assembled after the print. This is a scholar project.
## Updates
- 21.04 : I created the f3d file with all the components of the final product
- 25.04 : I desingned the case of the dolphin (the upper and the lower parts)
- 08.05 : I designed the crank-bar from the interior of the case, the gear with a handle that will animate the whole mechanism and added joints and motion study to demonstrate how the dolphin should move
- 12.05 : I added the pistons and the waves and tested some joint to simulate the motion
- 19.05 : I modified the base of the piston so it can have a solid base for the conctact set and added all the joints
- 22.05 : I inserted the dolphin and put it in the right place
- 23.05 : I changed the discs of the main crank because the motion wasn't right and did some final touches

The end!
